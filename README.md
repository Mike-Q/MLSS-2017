Requirements
------------

Download and install:

1) Graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org/
2) Gnuplot: http://www.gnuplot.info/
3) Gephi (on your personal computer): http://www.gephi.org/users/download/

Getting started
---------------

For the practical, you will need to work from a MAC or a linux machine (either locally, or remotely
using ssh). Download the [code](https://github.com/Networks-Learning/MLSS-2017/tree/master/code) and compile it as:

    $ cd code/ 

    $ make

Several warnings might appear when you compile the code package. As long as you do not get an Error message, you are fine. 

Now you can go to the subfolder mlss-17/ where you will start creating networks and coding following the tutorial [handout](https://github.com/Networks-Learning/MLSS-2017/blob/master/mlss-17-networks.pdf)!
