# MLSS 2017: Tutorial on Social Network Analysis


Getting started
---------------

For the practical, you will need to work from a MAC or a linux machine (either locally, or remotely
using ssh). Download the code package (https://github.com/Networks-Learning/ mlss-2017) and compile it as:

    $ cd code/ 

    $ make

Several warnings might appear when you compile the code package. As long as you do not get an Error message, you are fine. 

Requirements
------------

Download and install:
    - Graphviz: http://www.graphviz.org/
    - Gnuplot: http://www.gnuplot.info/
    - Gephi (on your personal computer): http://www.gephi.org/users/download/

Now you can go to the subfolder mlss-17/ where you will start creating net- works and coding!
